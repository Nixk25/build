<h1>HouseFix 🏠</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>
HouseFix is my very first project that laid the foundation for my journey into web development. Created two years ago, it focuses solely on frontend development, serving as a learning ground for fundamental frontend concepts.

<h2>Tech Stack 🛠️</h2>
The project utilizes basic frontend technologies:
<ul>
<li>HTML: Structuring the content.</li>
<li>CSS (including Sass): Styling and layout.</li>
<li>JavaScript: Adding interactivity and functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features 🌟</h2>
<ul>
<li>Static Web Pages: The project consists of static web pages, providing information about home improvement and repair services.</li>
<li>Responsive Design: The pages are designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Process 🚀</h2>

HouseFix was born out of the need to create a basic website for home repair services. I started by sketching wireframes and then proceeded to implement the design using HTML and CSS. Although it lacks backend functionality, it served as a valuable learning experience for understanding the frontend development process.
